# Guessing-Game-Java
The Enhanced Guessing Game, called "The Treasure of the Forgotten Temple", is a fun adventure game built using Java Swing. The game takes place in an ancient temple, where players have to guess a secret number with limited chances, like solving old riddles. There are three difficulty levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard—each with different time limits to make it more exciting. The game's look is simple but cool, with buttons that change color, a dark mode switch, progress bars, and text that adjusts to fit the screen. Players can explore different screens like a welcome page, countdown timer, the main guessing game, and feedback based on how they play. It also has a leaderboard and high score tracker to keep players interested and coming back for more.
